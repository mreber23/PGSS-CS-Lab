Downloaded Visual Studio Code
Python- miniconda or anaconda

Gave up on Lab info, decided to learn basics of coding on Python first.

Practiced adding, inputs, conversation-type things
  I used some russian :)
 
Began working on the Hangman game tutorial online. Exciting and very basic.

Maybe I will apply data to my practice later; this is a science class...
