My first time coding EVER
Python

Set up Google Drive and got Google Collaborator
saved examples from prof.
google sheet has contact info on one page
bottom tab has video links from lesson
Created Github account
Organized Week 01 folder and uploaded iris google sheet, Colab Notebook, and Markdown work

Analyzed Iris data imported from google sheets
applied to scateer plot, chart, and graph
eliminated "false" blanks in chart by replacing with NaN

RStudio Cloud

A long time to sit
my eyes hurt
I was very confused the whole time
